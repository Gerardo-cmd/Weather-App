            <p>Hello, my name is Gerardo Abaunza! I am self taught when it comes to aspects related to web development. This website was a small project with the purpose of practicing Node.js, Express, dynamic pages, building endpoints, and fetch requests!</p>
            <p>Two APIs (Mapbox and Weatherstack) are used in this project. Their links are provided below, so check them out!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a class="apiLink" href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox (used for locating places with coordinates)</a></li>
                <li><a class="apiLink" href="https://weatherstack.com/">Weatherstack(used to get forecast based on coordinates)</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Feel free to also visit <a href="https://github.com/Gerardo-cmd/Weather-App">my github</a> to view the code for this application as well as some of my other projects!</p>
